# Think Schemeless

Initially meant to try out [@schemeless/event-store](https://github.com/schemeless/event-store) which is an
open source library to bootstrap backend applications with an opinionated approach to event sourcing,
this project is refactored to be a NodeJS ported version of [think-clean-architecture](https://github.com/gyles/think-clean-architecture) in an attempt to prove that the opinionated approach to clean architecture
applies to any language and any library or framework.

## Pre-requisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Use node version 18.x.
- [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation). Use pnpm version 8.x.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Use the latest version.

## Quickstart

```
pnpm install
pnpm build
